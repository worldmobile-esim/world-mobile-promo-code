## About World Mobile

World Mobile is a mobile network operator (MNO) that runs its own decentralized core network while using a combination of its own last-mile infrastructure and partner carrier networks for coverage. This hybrid model allows it to provide mobile service without relying entirely on traditional carrier systems.

By operating its own network stack, World Mobile controls how traffic is routed and managed. This approach prioritizes user privacy, avoids data-selling business models common among traditional carriers, and gives users greater control over their connectivity, while still benefiting from broad and reliable coverage through carrier partnerships.

In simple terms, it is FAST, PRIVATE and RELIABLE - exactly what you should expect from your phone provider.

## Promo Codes and Referral Discounts

World Mobile uses a referral-based discount system that can reduce the cost of signing up, applying to the first month of a subscription.

### How referral discounts work

1. Visit [my.worldmobile.io](https://my.worldmobile.io/?affiliate=4PNYFN) to begin the signup process.
2. Choose your eSIM plan.
3. Enter the referral code **4PNYFN** at checkout.
4. Confirm that the discount is applied before completing payment.

### Important notes

- Referral discounts may be restricted to certain regions.
- Referral codes generally apply once per account.

If a referral code does not apply, it is usually due to eligibility requirements.

## World Mobile Plans at a Glance

World Mobile offers monthly phone plans designed for everyday use. All plans are billed month to month, activate digitally, and do not require long-term commitments.

### Phone plans

World Mobile currently offers three plans: **Essential**, **Advanced**, and **Global Access**.

The **Essential** and **Advanced** plans include voice, text, and data within the United States. The primary difference between them is the amount of priority data included each month:

- **Essential**: USD 59 per month, with 10 GB of priority data  
- **Advanced**: USD 85 per month, with 30 GB of priority data  

Both plans include:

- Unlimited calls, texts, and data, including hotspot usage
- Priority high-speed data delivered through a hybrid network model with broad U.S. coverage
- Month-to-month billing with no long-term contracts
- Built-in SIM security insurance
- Access to Premier Rewards and additional perks

These plans are suitable for users who want a primary or secondary phone line without being locked into a traditional carrier agreement.

### Global Access plan

The **Global Access** plan is a data-only option intended for business users and frequent international travelers. It removes the need to purchase or manage separate eSIMs and provides connectivity shortly after arrival.

Key features include:

- 20 GB of priority high-speed data, including hotspot use
- Coverage in over 70 countries
- Built-in SIM security insurance coverage up to USD 1,000,000
- Access to Premier Rewards
- No long-term contracts

## Phone Compatibility

Before signing up, it’s important to confirm that your device is compatible with World Mobile.

### Basic requirements

- The phone must be **carrier unlocked**
- eSIM plans require **eSIM support** on the device
- The device must support the required network bands

Most recent iPhone models and many newer Android devices meet these requirements, but compatibility can vary by exact model and region. At present, World Mobile does not support physical SIM cards, so an eSIM-compatible device is required.

## Is There a Trial?

World Mobile does not typically offer a free trial. However, because plans are contract-free and do not require immediate number porting, you can sign up for a month or two to evaluate the service and continue only if it meets your needs.

This approach allows you to test coverage and performance in real-world conditions.

## Refer & Earn Program

World Mobile’s **Refer & Earn** program allows existing subscribers to share referral links with others. When you sign up using our referral link, you receive a discount on your first month, and we may earn rewards if you remain subscribed.

- New users receive **50% off their first month** when joining through a referral link, along with priority support.
- Referrer rewards depend on the plan selected and how long the referred subscription remains active.
- Rewards are issued over time while the referral stays subscribed.
